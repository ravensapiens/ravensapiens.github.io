								<dt>Solfege School</dt>
								<dd>This music school, located in Tokyo and founded by renowned violinist Takiko Omura in 1961, offers a diverse range of music lessons for students of all ages. A central focus of the school is its special emphasis on early childhood education. The courses for young children are uniquely designed to allow them to experience music in a free and creative way, incorporating activities such as dancing, singing, and painting to help them feel and enjoy the music.<br><br>
									When I visited the school, I was immediately struck by the joy and enthusiasm of the children. It was clear that the atmosphere at the school is filled with a sense of fun, creativity, and freedom—qualities that I believe define the school’s identity.<br><br>
									Another standout feature of the school is its building, designed by the famous architect Junzo Yoshimura. The top floor, in particular, is a spacious area where students can move freely, dance, and express themselves without limitations.<br><br>
									For the website design, I wanted to capture the spirit of this creative environment by incorporating original artwork created by the students themselves. I felt that these drawings would serve as an authentic, personal reflection of the school’s atmosphere, giving visitors an intimate glimpse into the spaces of the building through the eyes of the students.<br><br>
