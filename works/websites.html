								<dt>Solfege School</dt>
								<dd>This music school, located in Tokyo and founded by renowned violinist Takiko Omura in 1961, offers a diverse range of music lessons for students of all ages. A central focus of the school is its special emphasis on early childhood education. The courses for young children are uniquely designed to allow them to experience music in a free and creative way, incorporating activities such as dancing, singing, and painting to help them feel and enjoy the music.<br><br>
									When I visited the school, I was immediately struck by the joy and enthusiasm of the children. It was clear that the atmosphere at the school is filled with a sense of fun, creativity, and freedom—qualities that I believe define the school’s identity.<br><br>
									Another standout feature of the school is its building, designed by the famous architect Junzo Yoshimura. The top floor, in particular, is a spacious area where students can move freely, dance, and express themselves without limitations.<br><br>
									For the website design, I wanted to capture the spirit of this creative environment by incorporating original artwork created by the students themselves. I felt that these drawings would serve as an authentic, personal reflection of the school’s atmosphere and music education.<br><br>
